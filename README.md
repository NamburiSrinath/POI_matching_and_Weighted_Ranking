# POI matching and Weighted Ranking

This is the work I did as part of my 3 month intern in LocTruth. It involves

1. poi_classification.py --> Given GPS data of a user, and POI (Point of Interest) locations, find out the places the user has visited and rank the most frequent places a user has visited (using Weighted Ranking Algorithm, where I calculated few features such as Time spend on each visit, no of times visiting in a week etc;) 
2. trajectory.py --> Map the POI locations and the places a user visited. It's just a helper function to better visualize
